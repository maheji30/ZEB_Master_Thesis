\section{Energy Buildings: A Critical Look at the Definition}

The aim of this document is to explore the concept of zero energy: what it means and why a clear and measurable definition is needed. This document defines a net zero-energy building (ZEB) as a construction with greatly reduced energy needs through efficiency gains such that the balance of the energy needs can be supplied by renewable technologies. A ZEB typically uses traditional energy sources such as the electric and natural gas utilities when on-site generation does not meet the loads. When the on-site generation is greater than the building’s loads, excess electricity is exported to the utility grid. By using the grid to account for the energy balance, excess production can offset later energy use. Achieving a ZEB without the grid would be very difficult, as the current generation of storage technologies is limited. A zero energy building can be defined in several ways, depending on the boundary and the metric. Different definitions may be appropriate, depending on the project goals and the values of the design team and building owner. For example, building owners typically care about energy costs. Organizations such as DOE are concerned with national energy numbers, and are typically interested in primary or source energy. A building designer may be interested in site energy use for energy code requirements. Finally, those who are concerned about pollution from power plants and the burning of fossil fuels may be interested in reducing emissions. Four commonly used definitions are: net zero site energy, net zero source energy, net zero energy costs, and net zero energy emissions. A Net Zero Site Energy produces at least as much energy as it uses in a year, when accounted for at the site. A Net Zero Source Energy produces at least as much energy as it uses in a year, when accounted for at the source. Source energy refers to the primary energy used to generate and deliver the energy to the site. To calculate a building’s total source energy, imported and exported energy is multiplied by the appropriate site-to-source conversion multipliers. In the Net Zero Energy Costs, the amount of money the utility pays the building owner for the energy the building exports to the grid is at least equal to the amount the owner pays the utility for the energy services and energy used over the year. Net Zero Energy Emissions produces at least as much emissions-free renewable energy as it uses from emissions-producing energy sources. The zero energy definition affects how buildings are designed to achieve the goal. It can
emphasize energy efficiency, supply-side strategies, purchased energy sources, utility rate
structures, or whether fuel-switching and conversion accounting can help meet the goal.

\section{Extension of the PMV model to non-air-conditioned buildings in warm climates}
The PMV model agrees well with high-quality field studies in buildings with HVAC systems, situated in cold, temperate and warm climates, studied during both summer and winter. In non-air-conditioned buildings in warm climates, occupants may sense the warmth as being less severe than the PMV predicts. The main factor that explains this phenomenon is the expectations of the occupants, which are people who have been living in hot environments. They are likely to judge a warm environment as less unacceptable than people who are used to air conditioning. This can be expressed by an expectation factor, \textit{e}. This factor varies between 0.5 and 1, the latter being the appropriate value for buildings with air conditioning. For buildings without air conditioning, it is assumed that the expectation factor depends on the duration of warm weather during the year and whether there are other buildings in the region with air conditioning. Thus, if the weather is hot all year or most of the year and there are few or no other buildings with air conditioning, \textit{e} may be 0.5, whereas it may be 0.7 if there are many other buildings with air-conditioning. A second factor contributing to this difference is the estimated activity. In many office field studies, metabolic rate is estimated with a questionnaire that identifies the percentage of time the person was sitting, standing, or walking. This approach fails to acknowledge the fact that people, when they feel hot, unconsciously tend to slow down their activity. They adapt to the hot environment by slowing down their metabolic rate. The lower rate in hot environments should be recognized by inserting a reduced metabolic rate when calculating PMV. Subsequent studies were conducted in various offices, where the recorded metabolic rates were reduced by 6.7\% for each PMV scale unit above neutrality. In conclusion, to calculate de ePMV the metabolic rate is reduced by 6.7\% for each PMV scale unit. With this reduced metabolic rate, PMV is recalculated. Finally, the PMV obtained is multiplied by the appropriate \textit{e}. The extended PMV model agrees well with quality field studies in non-air-conditioned buildings of three continents.



      

\section{Lessons Learned from Case Studies of Six High-Performance Building}
The goal of this report is to combine and highlight the primary lessons learned from the case studies to help inform and direct future design studies and implementations to work towards ZEBs. NREL studied six buildings to understand the issues related to the design, construction, operation, and evaluation of the current generation of low energy commercial buildings. Each case study developed a list of lessons learned and recommendations relevant to that unique building These buildings and the lessons learned from them help inform a set of best practices, beneficial design elements, technologies, and techniques that should be encouraged in future buildings, as well as pitfalls to be avoided. The document captured a set of best practices that result from the lessons learned from these six buildings. Best practices are proven real-world technologies and processes that lead to high-performance buildings. The list is the result of the experience with the six case study buildings.

\section{Criteria of sustainable construction - UNAM}
This document consists in a guide that establishes technical, preventive, corrective and safety measures in the construction and remodeling of university buildings, with the aim of minimizing the negative effects that impact the environment, taking advantage of natural resources and elements in a sustainable manner.  The objective of this document is to provide the UNAM dependencies with guidelines for proper management in the use, exploitation and saving of water and electricity from the project and during the construction and operation of the buildings.

Important elements to consider: This document contains important information about the buildings at CU-UNAM, such as lighting levels, dimensions of sanitary and education spaces, characteristics of the envelope and the standards involved.

\section{Net-Zero Energy Buildings: the influence of definition on greenhouse gas emissions}

This study compares the effectiveness of the four NZEB definitions to reduce operational emissions of a building. A simple geometry located in two different cities, that is, Toronto and Miami, with four different energy behaviors, which are simulated in OpenStudio, is used. It was found that, for both locations, the use of a NZEC balance leads to lower emissions, a reduction of 102-145$\%$ for Toronto and 99-117$\%$ for Miami. The NZEE definition, contrary to its designation, is the least effective in reducing GHG emissions, at 86$\%$ for Toronto and 89-94$\%$ for Miami.

Important elements to consider: The article shows the most important equations to develop each of the definitions.


\section{A review of net zero energy buildings in hot and humid climates: Experience learned from 34 case study buildings}
This paper provides a comprehensive review of NZEBs and their current development in hot and humid regions. Through investigating 34 NZEB cases around the world, this study summarized NZEB key design strategies, technology choices and energy performance. The study found that passive design and technologies such as daylighting and natural ventilation are often adopted for NZEBs in hot and humid climates, together with other energy efficient and renewable energy technologies.  The Xingye building case demonstrated that natural ventilation could reduce the building's cooling energy from 2.5 kWh/m2 to less than 0.5 kWh/m2 per month — an 80\% cooling energy reduction in the shoulder seasons compared with the summer season. With daylighting, the Xingye building demonstrated that monthly lighting energy intensity can be controlled less than 0.5 kWh/m2.

\section{Ten questions about zero energy buildings: A state of the art review.}
This document has the aim of identifying, developing and understanding the main characteristics of zero energy buildings. For this, a review of the state of the art of the topic is carried out, where 97 articles considered to be of greater relevance were selected, in the period from 2006 to 2020. The methodology consisted of an analysis of these texts based on ten questions formulated to address the topic. The questions refer to definitions (P1), sustainability (P2), technologies involved (P3), emissions (P5), energy (P4) (P6) (P7), regulations (P8), climate change (P9) and future projections (P10). The work allows us to conclude that the ZEBs are integrated in a holistic way in the transformation towards a renewable and sustainable future in terms of energy solutions and have the potential to be implemented in different geographical and climatic positions.


Important elements to consider: Consumption for heating and cooling is usually the highest in buildings, so the reviewed literature proposes achieving savings in ZEB, between $\%$25 and $\%$50, respectively, limiting both at 30 $\frac{kWh}{m^{2}*year}$.


\section{A Guide to Zero Energy and Zero Energy Ready K–12 Schools}

This document describes the steps to create a ZE school. These steps serve as a guide to ensure that a school achieves its ZE design goal and maintains its ZE status after it is occupied and operational. The topics covered in the steps are: Assessment of the needs of a building, integration of zero energy goals in the design, management of goals in the design and operation phases, performance evaluation, etc. Each step also includes an experience about the step. These brief anecdotes were provided by the participating school districts and offer a brief synopsis of the district's experience with that step.


\section{Analysis of the environmental, energy and economic effects between a sustainable construction model and a conventional one in Querétaro}

The document focuses on performing an analysis of the environmental, energy and economic effects resulting from the construction of buildings using a sustainability model compared to a conventional model, in order to obtain a cost indicator when using a sustainable construction model to a house and see if it is possible that it is not more than 15$\%$ against using a traditional construction model. 3 traditional housing models and 3 sustainable housing models were proposed to make comparisons between them. The energy and thermal simulation of all the cases was carried out in EnergyPlus. Comparing the best-equipped sustainable housing model with the worst-equipped traditional housing model, the percentage increase in cost was 14.75\$%$.

Important elements to consider: Site-to-Source conversion factors, CO2 emission factors, Occupancy schedules and residential loads and take into account inflation and NPV in the calculation of savings.

\section{Methodology for the validation of thermal simulations of a real building}

This document shows a methodology to validate thermal simulations of a real building. Comparison metrics and tolerance ranges, both obtained from the literature, are also included. An IER building is used as a case study. Two cases are proposed, a base case where sun protection is used and another one where it is not used. The results include graphs for qualitative comparison of the measurement and the two simulated cases. A quantitative comparison was made using the most common metrics described in the literature review. In both comparisons, the result obtained for case 2 is better than for case 1, this suggests that the solar protections of the building are absorbing heat, due to the red color, and are transmitting heat by conduction and radiation to the interior of the building.


Important elements to consider: It is likely that for the ZEB thesis data will need to be collected from the building of interest, for which a correct validation will need to be carried out. This thesis can be a good guide in case I don't remember very well what the methodology was like.


\section{Thermal comfort studies}

The aim of this document is to explore the evaluation of thermal comfort that the use of passive strategies and low energy consumption provides to occupants in naturally ventilated buildings. In this work, a methodology is proposed for the validation of thermal simulations, whose results show that the building model obtained with the calibration process is applicable to different times of the year, occupancy and ventilation conditions, as well as obtaining accurate results of the thermal comfort assessment using night ventilation strategies and change in the absorptivity of the envelope. The thesis also proposes a methodology for the evaluation of thermal, acoustic and light comfort in the design stage of the new IER building, for which it is proposed to use the extended predicted mean vote method.


Important elements to consider: The validation methodology of the bachelor thesis is used. The document contains important information about the PMVe.
